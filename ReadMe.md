This project addresses the challenge of predicting international crude oil prices to enhance China's energy and economic security. Given the significant impact of crude oil fluctuations on China's economy and industries, accurate price predictions are crucial for informed policy-making, investments, and risk management. The project combines descriptive statistics, regression modeling, and LSTM neural network models to achieve accurate price forecasts.

Problem Background:
Crude oil holds crucial importance for energy and carries economic and political implications due to its volatility. China's rapid growth has led to a substantial increase in oil demand, making the country heavily reliant on imports (73.5% in 2020). Fluctuating international oil prices directly affect China's economic stability and industrial sectors.

Problem Statement:
The project's main objective is to predict international crude oil prices, with the aim of ensuring China's energy and economic security. Accurate price predictions enable effective policy formulation, investment decisions, and risk management strategies. The project proposes a novel approach by combining econometric models and machine learning techniques to provide interval or probability-based predictions.

Expected Outcomes:
The project intends to gain insights into crude oil price changes using descriptive statistics and regression modeling. Subsequently, LSTM neural network models will be utilized for precise price predictions. The project will then visualize both historical data and predicted trends, providing valuable insights into future price movements.

Solution Approach:
1.Required Dataset: 
The project utilizes diverse datasets including historical data of crude oil futures prices from the New York Mercantile Exchange (obtained through web scraping), crude oil spot prices from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), world crude oil production data from EIA, U.S. Dollar Index (USDX) data from a financial source, and the VIX panic index data from another financial source.
2.Data Collection Method:
Data collection involves web scraping for crude oil futures prices and downloading from relevant databases such as EIA and financial sources for the remaining datasets.
3.Final Presentation:
The project's solution will showcase future trends in international crude oil spot prices extending beyond the available sample data. This will be achieved through the presentation of regression fitting, training, and prediction results. Ultimately, the project aims to provide valuable insights for better decision-making in China's energy and economic domains.
